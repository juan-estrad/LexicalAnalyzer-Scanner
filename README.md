# Scanner and Parser in Java  

## Overview  
This project is a **Java-based Scanner and Parser** developed to perform:  
1. **Lexical Analysis:** Breaking down input into tokens like keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.  
2. **Syntax Analysis:** Validating the structure of tokenized input against a predefined grammar using recursive descent parsing.  

The program includes robust error handling to report and debug invalid tokens and syntax errors effectively.  

## Features  
- **Tokenization:**  
  - Recognizes keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and delimiters.  
  - Outputs a list of tokens along with their types.  
- **Syntax Validation:**  
  - Implements recursive descent parsing to ensure token sequences adhere to grammar rules.  
  - Detects and reports syntax errors with detailed feedback.  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Identifies lexical errors during scanning.  
  - Reports syntax errors during parsing with descriptive messages for debugging.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Version Control:** GitHub
